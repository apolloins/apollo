# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Working with the user

Communicate with the user in Chinese (中文) in this project.

Software not already available locally may be installed ad hoc via `nix shell nixpkgs#<package>` (or `nix develop`) rather than modifying the system — e.g. `nix shell nixpkgs#imagemagick -c magick ...` was used to crop team WeChat QR code screenshots down to just the QR card.

## Project

Marketing/informational website for Apollo Insurance (阿波罗保险公司 / Assurance Apollo), a sub-brand of AssurPV based in Brossard, Quebec, Canada, serving Chinese-speaking clients. Built with Astro + Tailwind CSS, deployed to Netlify (with a Netlify Function handling the contact form).

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start local dev server at `localhost:4321`
- `npm run build` — build production site to `./dist/`
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally
- `npm run astro ...` — run Astro CLI commands (e.g. `npm run astro check` for type checking)

There is no test suite or linter configured in this project.

## Architecture

### Multilingual routing (no i18n framework)

The site is available in four languages with no use of Astro's built-in i18n routing — instead, content is duplicated into four parallel directory trees:

- `src/pages/zh/*` — Simplified Chinese (the default/primary language)
- `src/pages/zh-hant/*` — Traditional Chinese (generated from `zh` with OpenCC `s2tw`, e.g. `nix shell nixpkgs#opencc -c opencc -c s2tw.json -i in -o out`, then hand-fixed: `lang` constants, 併→並 where needed, 聯繫我們→聯絡我們)
- `src/pages/en/*` — English
- `src/pages/fr/*` — French

Each tree has the same eight pages: `index`, `about`, `services`, `team`, `claims`, `faq`, `news`, `contact`, plus `news/[slug].astro` for individual news articles (see **News** below). `src/pages/index.astro` (the site root) does a client-side redirect to `/zh/`.

**When adding, removing, or restructuring a page, the change must be replicated across all four language directories** to keep them in sync. There's no shared content source — each locale's copy is written directly into its own `.astro` file.

### Layouts

- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` is the real layout used by every page. It takes `title`, `description`, and `lang` (`'zh' | 'zh-hant' | 'en' | 'fr'`) props, and contains inline per-language UI strings (nav labels, footer copy, language-switcher labels) in a `uiText`/translation-object pattern. Header nav links and the language switcher are generated from `lang` and `Astro.url.pathname`, so cross-language links are produced by swapping the `/zh-hant|zh|en|fr` path prefix rather than through routing config (`zh-hant` must be matched before `zh`).
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro` is the unmodified Astro starter template — not used by any real page. Leave it alone or remove it; don't build new pages on it.

New pages/sections should follow the same pattern as existing ones: add localized strings inline (or in a small object) per page/component rather than introducing a new i18n mechanism, unless asked to.

### News (新闻动态)

News is **maintained by Claude on the user's behalf**: the user supplies the facts (often briefly, in Chinese), and Claude writes up the full item — expanding, polishing, and translating it into all four languages. There is no CMS.

**Where things live**

- Content: `src/content/news/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>/{zh,zh-hant,en,fr}.md` — one folder per item, one Markdown file per language. Schema in `src/content.config.ts`.
- Images: `public/news/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>/…`, referenced in frontmatter as `/news/<slug>/cover.jpg`. Resize/compress before adding (e.g. `nix shell nixpkgs#imagemagick -c magick in.jpg -resize 1600x1600\> -quality 82 cover.jpg`).
- Rendering: `src/components/NewsList.astro` (list on `/{lang}/news`), `src/components/NewsArticle.astro` (article page), `src/lib/news.ts` (loading, sorting, per-language UI strings, date formatting). Article body styles are `.news-body` in `src/styles/global.css`.
- The list page shows the "coming soon" placeholder (the `empty` slot in each `news.astro`) only while there are no published items.

**Frontmatter**

```yaml
---
title: "…"
date: 2026-10-01          # publication date; list is sorted newest first
category: company         # company (公司动态) | industry (行业资讯) | local (本地新闻)
summary: "…"              # 1–2 sentences; shown in the list and as meta description
image: /news/2026-10-01-slug/cover.jpg   # optional
imageAlt: "…"                            # optional, localized
source:                                  # optional; required for industry/local items
  name: "La Presse"
  url: "https://…"
draft: false              # true hides the item everywhere
---
```

**Rules**

- **All four languages are mandatory.** `src/lib/news.ts` fails the build if a published item is missing any language, because the flag switcher on an article page links to the same slug in every language.
- Slug: publication date + short English kebab-case, e.g. `2026-10-01-new-office-hours`. It is identical across languages and becomes the URL.
- Write `zh` first, then `zh-hant` (OpenCC `s2tw` as a starting point, then review: 聯繫我們→聯絡我們, 併/並, HK/TW wording), then natural — not literal — `en` and `fr`. Keep the translations aligned in content: same facts, headings and structure.
- Tone and terminology should match the rest of the site (e.g. the insurance terms used in `services`/`faq`/`claims`). Do not describe Apollo as serving only Chinese clients; the team serves clients in French, English, Mandarin and Cantonese.
- **Industry/local news: summarize in our own words and link to the source** (`source` field); never reprint articles or copy their images. Add a short "what this means for you" angle where relevant — that is the value we add.
- Do not invent facts, figures, dates, quotes or regulatory details. Anything missing from what the user provided that the article needs → ask, or check an authoritative source and cite it. Apollo is a partner of AssurPV, not an insurer or claims adjuster — avoid wording that implies Apollo makes coverage or claims decisions.
- Workflow per item: write the four files → `npm run build` (must pass) → show the user the Chinese version (and anything uncertain) → commit and push to `origin` only after the user confirms.

### Contact form

The contact form (`src/pages/{lang}/contact.astro`) submits via `fetch` to `/.netlify/functions/submit-contact`, handled by `netlify/functions/submit-contact.js`. That function:

- Uses `Resend` (env var `RESEND_API_KEY`) to send two emails per submission: a localized confirmation to the submitter and a notification to `ADMIN_EMAIL` (default `info@apolloins.ca`), from `FROM_EMAIL` (default `noreply@notifications.apolloins.ca`).
- Selects email copy/subject based on the `lang` field in the POST body (`zh`/`zh-hant`/`en`/`fr`), with English as the fallback.
- All four languages' email templates and subject-line translations live inline in this one file — keep them in sync when editing the confirmation/admin templates or the subject list.

### Styling

Tailwind CSS (via `@astrojs/tailwind`) with a custom brand palette defined in `tailwind.config.mjs`: `primary` (#1F4E79), `secondary` (#FFC000), `accent` (#4472C4), `light` (#F2F2F2), `dark` (#333333). Use these tokens rather than raw hex/arbitrary colors for brand-consistent UI.

### Deployment

`netlify.toml` builds with `npm run build`, publishes `dist/`, and points Netlify Functions at `netlify/functions/`. A catch-all redirect (`/*` → `/index.html`, 200) is in place for client-side routing. `astro.config.mjs` allows dev-server hosts `appolo.smartcubes.uk` and `apolloins.ca`.

Netlify (hosting) is managed under the `info@apolloins.ca` account: site `superb-caramel-0ef0d0`, serving `www.apolloins.ca`, auto-deploying from `apolloins/apollo` `main`. The site env vars `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `FROM_EMAIL` live only in Netlify. Cloudflare (DNS + proxy) is still under `apolloassurance@gmail.com`, and the Resend key in use still belongs to the old Resend account (`notifications.apolloins.ca` is verified only there). The site was moved from the old Netlify account (`apolloassurance@gmail.com`, site `apolloassurance`) on 2026-10-06; the old site is kept, without a domain, as a fallback. API tokens are kept locally outside the repo (git-ignored `.secret` / `.env`), never committed.

### Git remotes

- `origin` — `apolloins/apollo` (company account, `info@apolloins.ca`). Primary; pushing `main` here deploys the site.
- `apolloassurance/apollo` (old company account) and `adamscao/apollo` (personal account) are older copies. They are not configured as remotes in clones made from `apolloins` and are no longer deploy sources.

SSH identity per account is selected through host aliases in `~/.ssh/config` (e.g. `github-info:apolloins/apollo.git`), so it must be set up once per machine.
